# Business AI: Designing a Business Recommendation System Using Data Analysis and Deep Learning
UPDATE (January 5, 2019): I am almost finished debugging and cleaning my code, but in the meantime, I have pushed what I have to this repository. So please excuse that some files are clean and some need work. The technical report is also on the way.

This repository contains research from my Research Experience for Undergraduates in Machine Learning. The goal was to design a Business Recommendation System using Data Analysis and Deep Learning.
