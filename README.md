# Business AI: Designing a Business Recommendation System Using Data Analysis and Deep Learning

UPDATE (January 5, 2019): I am almost finished debugging and cleaning my code, but in the meantime, I have pushed what I have to this repository. So please excuse that some files are clean and some need work. I have also included the current technical report for a view into what the project entailed. We are currently preparing to publish.

This repository contains research from my Research Experience for Undergraduates in Machine Learning. The goal was to design a Business Recommendation System using Data Analysis and Deep Learning.
