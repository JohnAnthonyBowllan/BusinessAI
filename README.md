# Business AI: Designing a Business Recommendation System Using Data Analysis and Deep Learning
This repository contains research from my Research Experience for Undergraduates in machine learning. This was one of the most fun and most transformative educational experiences of my life! The goal was to design a Business Recommendation System using data analysis and deep learning. Data analysis was used to visualize features, generate new ones, and further discover the problem while machine learning was used to accurately predict user business ratings from user features, item features, and the historical interactions between the two.

I have included the current technical report (revising for publishing) for a view into what the project entailed and the context for the code:

Below you will find a couple my favorite models/visualizations used through out the project.

## Nested Stochastic Block Model (NSBM): communities of business categories
The exterior images represent some of the nodes on the perimeter of the circle and the interior of the NSBM the 
interplay between the nodes. This method groups similar business categories and discriminates dissimilar ones.
